# Entity Browser Generic Embed

A generic/global embed text area for Entity Browsers that allows you to paste any URL to create a media entity based on the URL schema.

Inspired by the work in the [Lightning](https://www.drupal.org/project/lightning) Drupal distribution and the [Lighting Media](https://www.drupal.org/project/lightning_media) module.

Example plugins are here: [Entity Browser Generic Embed Plugins](https://github.com/Vardot/entity_browser_generic_embed_plugins) modules to integrate with more media types.
