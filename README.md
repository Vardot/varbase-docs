## **Introduction**

Varbase is an enhanced Drupal distribution packed with adaptive functionalities and essential modules, that speed up your development, and provides you with standardized configurations, making your life easier.

The essence of Varbase, lies within the basic concept that initiated it; \[DRY \(Don’t Repeat Yourself\)\]\(\[[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Don't\_repeat\_yourself\]\(https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Don't\_repeat\_yourself\)\](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Don't_repeat_yourself]%28https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Don't_repeat_yourself%29\)\). Varbase handles that for you, relieving you from repeating all the modules, features, configurations that are included in every Drupal project.

Varbase can bring ease to you if you are:

* Confused about choosing the appropriate module needed for a specific functionality.
* Trying to bridge the gap between the users experience and editors experience.
* Being overwhelmed by the complexity of making a fully-fledged Drupal CMS website.
* Wasting so much time on choosing the suitable functionalities.
