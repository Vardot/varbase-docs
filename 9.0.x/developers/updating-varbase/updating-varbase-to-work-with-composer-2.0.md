**As for** [**Varbase 8.8.8**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase/releases/8.x-8.8) **and** [**Varbase 9.0.0-rc1**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase/releases/9.0.0-rc1)**, Varbase works with both Composer 1.0 and Composer 2.0**&#x20;

Recommended to build all new **Varbase Projects** with **Composer 2.0**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If the site was built recently with the listed latest releases [**Varbase 8.8.8**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase/releases/8.x-8.8) or [**Varbase 9.0.0-rc1**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase/releases/9.0.0-rc1), but the project was built using the **Composer 1.0** version. The site is ready to start using **Composer 2.0**

Only update the **Composer** from **1.0** to **2.0**

Do a`composer update`to update the autoloaders, namespaces map, and classes map.

Check the complete changelog.\
[https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0](https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0)

When having any custom composer plugins or still having issues.\
Or if modules are using the old way of autoloading

> Custom **Composer** plugins must have\
> `"composer-plugin-api": "^1.1 || ^2"`

> Make sure that the root `composer.json` file do not have invalid **`PSR-0`** / **`PSR-4`** . And the class configurations will not autoload anymore in `optimized-autoloader` mode, as per the warnings introduced in 1.10

**Known issues:**

[**Composer 2.0** issue for **bower-asset/jqueryui-touch-punch** library default branch](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase/issues/3190703)



After [**Composer 2.2.1**](https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.2.1) was released **2021-12-22**

* Fixed plugin autoloading including files autoload rules from the root package ([#10382](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/10382))

Update the root `composer.json` file with the following composer config

```
  "config": {
    "bin-dir": "bin/",
    "secure-http": false,
    "optimize-autoloader": true,
    "preferred-install": {
      "drupal/core": "dist"
    },
    "allow-plugins": {
      "composer/installers": true,
      "cweagans/composer-patches": true,
      "oomphinc/composer-installers-extender": true,
      "drupal/core-composer-scaffold": true,
      "drupal/core-project-message": true,
      "vardot/varbase-updater": true
    }
  },
```

Rebuild the autoloader for map of classes and namespaces

```
cd /PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT
rm -rf composer.lock bin/ vendor/ docroot/modules/contrib/ docroot/themes/contrib/ docroot/profiles/varbase/ docroot/libraries/
composer install -vvv
cd docroot/
drush cr
```
