# Clearing Varbase Cache

### How to Clear Varbase Cache?

There are two approaches where to clear the caches:

**The first approach** which is the easiest way, hover the Varbase icon and you will notice _Flush all caches_ then click it. The Varbase will now clear all your caches, this might take a couple of seconds then a message will appear indicating your caches are cleared.
