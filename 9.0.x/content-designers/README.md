# Content Designers

This section is a reference and guideline for administering and managing the content. Projects built over Varbase are using Drupal 9. Drupal is a Content Management System that allows users to log in and make changes and create new content across the site. This documentation is to explain how the features work out-of-the-box, from a website admin or content designer/editor point of view.
