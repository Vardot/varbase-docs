# Content Moderation

## Overview

Content moderation in Varbase is a fairly simple concept: You can create and manage custom workflows for specific types of content. \
\
Workflows simply determine the various stages (or moderations states) used when creating content.

Within each workflow, you can manage two specific parts:

* Moderation States (Draft, Published, Archived, etc.)
* Moderation Transitions (moving from Draft to Published, Published to Archived, etc.)

Admins can add whatever workflow states they need to suit their teamâ€™s unique editorial process.
