# How to Get Support

## Varbase is Open Source

[Varbase](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase) is developed by a core team of experienced Drupal developments and is funded and supported by [Vardot](https://www.vardot.com/), a leading Drupal agency with offices in the USA, Egypt, and Jordan.

[Varbase](https://www.gitbook.com/book/vardot/varbase/edit) is available as an Open Source and FREE software for developers and development teams to install, host, and run it yourself.

Open Source software is free and promotes the collaboration and sharing of ideas. Varbase was built on top of Drupal, which is Open Source and is completely free. Everyone should [contribute something](https://www.drupal.org/contribute), sometimes simply reporting and maybe fixing a minor bug can make a difference. The Drupal [community](https://www.drupal.org/community) and the [marketplace](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services) make money supporting Drupal. If you need a feature or support you should contact the Varbase [maintainer](https://www.vardot.com/contact).

## But I Need Professional Support

Varbase provides a great deal of functionality out of the box, which makes it possible for you to prototype your knowledge base, and try out and experiment with all the available features.

However, if you need professional support for implementation, customization, training, or hosted management, please contact Vardot at [https://www.vardot.com/contact](https://www.vardot.com/contact)

You may also contact [Vardot](https://www.vardot.com/) for professional and enterprise support of Varbase by sending an email to: [sales@vardot.com](mailto:sales@vardot.com?subject=Requesting%20Vardoc%20Professional%20Support)
