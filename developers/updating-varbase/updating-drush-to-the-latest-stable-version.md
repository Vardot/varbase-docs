## **Drush and the Update Helper**

The [**Update Helper**](https://www.drupal.org/project/update\_helper) `~3.0` is using `"drush/drush": "~11.0"` and the [**Drupal Core Generator** ](https://github.com/Chi-teck/drupal-code-generator) package is using `"chi-teck/drupal-code-generator": "^2.4"`

[#3260567: Updated the Update Helper module from \~2.0 to \~3.0](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase\_core/issues/3260567)

In `require-dev` of the module

{% embed url="https://git.drupalcode.org/project/update_helper/-/blob/3.0.x/composer.json#L32" %}
Update Helper `composer.json` file has `"`[`drush/drush`](https://packagist.org/packages/drush/drush)`": "`[`~11.0`](https://packagist.org/packages/drush/drush)`"`
{% endembed %}

This module has the Drush command. In order to execute it properly, you have to use Drush installed with your project.\
In the case of composer build, it's: `[project directory]/vendor/bin/drush`

They started to ask developers to use the drush command. not the one in the global, the one in the vendor.

## Drush Use in Varbase

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Not recommended** to use the local global drush or the server global drush
{% endhint %}

### Use the Direct Drush from Vendor

Change the directory in the terminal to the project directory.

```
cd [project directory]
```

Run the following command for example:

```
./vendor/drush/drush/drush cr
```

Then command will use the local drush command directly from `vender` in case the following composer config was not in the **root** `composer.json` file for the project

```json
    "bin-dir": "bin/",
```

### Use the Aliased Drush Command From the Bin folder

The default [Varbase Project](https://github.com/Vardot/varbase-project/blob/9.0.x/composer.json#L42) template has the  `"bin-dir": "bin/",`composer config in the **root** `composer.json` file.

If the current working directory was the `docroot` folder in the opened terminal

```
cd [project directory]/docroot
```

Run the following command for example:

```
../bin/drush cr
```
