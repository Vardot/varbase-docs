# Switch From Node SASS to Dart SASS for Old Sub-Themes

> **Warning:** [**LibSass and Node Sass are deprecated**](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated). While they will continue to receive maintenance releases indefinitely, there are no plans to add additional features or compatibility with any new CSS or Sass features. Projects that still use it should move onto [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass).

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

* The maintainers no longer recommend LibSass for new Sass projects. Use [**Dart Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) instead.
* The maintainers recommend all existing LibSass users make plans to eventually move onto Dart Sass, and that all Sass libraries make plans to eventually drop support for LibSass.
* The maintainers are no longer planning to add any new features to LibSass, including compatibility with new CSS features.
* LibSass and **Node Sass** will continue to be maintained indefinitely on a best-effort basis, including fixing major bugs and security issues and maintaining compatibility with the latest Node versions.

## When to Switch to Dart Sass

It is an optional direction to use the latest **Dart Sass** in old projects. An old project can stay using the old **Node Sass** package compiler. But the NPM or Yarn may face issues with old packages which are related to old not updated or no longer maintained.

{% hint style="success" %}
Projects which had generated a new sub-theme using the [**`Vartheme BS4 9.0.13`**](https://www.drupal.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/releases/9.0.13) and later do not need to do anything. They are using **Dart Sass** already.



Issue [#3269723](https://www.drupal.org/i/3269723): Switched from deprecated [**Node Sass**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) to [**Dart Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) compiler using [**Gulp**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)
{% endhint %}



Old sub-themes which had been generated from an older **Vartheme BS4** version. **9.0.11** and older should follow the following steps to have the full switch:

## Update Npm and Nodejs to \~16 Lts Version

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash - 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install build-essential

curl -L https://npmjs.com/install.sh | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install npm
```

## Switch From Node Sass to Dart Sass Compiler

* Change the **package.json** file with the following main important changes. Update local packages by running `yarn install` in the folder of the theme.

```php
    ...
    ...
    "sass": "~1",
    "gulp": "~4",
    "gulp-autoprefixer": "~8",
    "gulp-clean-css": "~4",
    "gulp-concat": "~2",
    "gulp-csscomb": "~3",
    "gulp-filter": "~7",
    "gulp-html-replace": "~1",
    "gulp-postcss": "~8",
    "gulp-rename": "~2",
    "gulp-sass": "~5",
    "gulp-scss-lint": "~1",
    "gulp-sourcemaps": "~3",
    "gulp-uglify": "~3",
    ...
    ...
```

* Change the **gulpfile.js** file from having the following required statements for the SASS object:  &#x20;

From `sass = require("gulp-sass"),`

To     `sass = require("gulp-sass")(require('sass')),`&#x20;

* Change the [package.json](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/package.json) file
* Change the [gulpfile.js](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/gulpfile.js) file
* Delete the [.browserslistrc](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.11/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.browserslistrc) file
* Change the [.eslintrc.json](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.eslintrc.json) file
* Change the [.eslintignore](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.eslintignore) file
* Change the [.stylelintrc.json](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.stylelintrc.json) file
* Change the [.stylelintignore](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.stylelintignore) file
* Add the new [.prettierrc.json](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.prettierrc.json) file
* Add the new [.prettierignore](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.prettierignore) file
* Change the [.csscomb.json ](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/vartheme\_bs4/-/blob/9.0.13/VARTHEME\_BS4\_SUBTHEME/.csscomb.json)file

This includes an all-new update for coding standards and linting with the **Drupal Core**.

## Re-Compile Your Scss Files to CSS Using the New Dart Sass

After changing all needed files

Run `yarn install`

and `yarn theme:build` or `gulp compile`&#x20;

Check on changes after the re-compile and regression testing will be needed for sure.

Add the needed [Built-in Modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules) from Dart Sass\
Add `@use 'sass:math';` to the top of the file\
and use **math.div**

## Known Issues After the Switch

In case forgotten to add the `@use 'sass:math';`

Custom SCSS files with old node-sass math divisions should be changed to use the [**sass:math**](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/math) **module.**

If not the `yarn theme:build` or `gulp compile` will face issues like:

```php
Deprecation Warning: Using / for division outside of calc() is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.

Recommendation: math.div($hero-max-height, 2) or calc($hero-max-height / 2)
