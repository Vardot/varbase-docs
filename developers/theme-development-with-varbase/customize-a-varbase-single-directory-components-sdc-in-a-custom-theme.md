# Customize a Varbase Single Directory Components (SDC) In a Custom Theme

The components folder contains various **Single Directory Components (SDC)**. To enhance the default components, Projects are using the components provided by [**Varbase Components**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase\_components) module.

To replace any component from the **Varbase Components** module, follow the example below:

#### Example:

Suppose we have a custom style for the Alert component on our site, which differs from the default style. Here are the steps to implement the custom style:

## Copy the Varbase Component to the Custom theme

Copy the alert folder from **Varbase Components** to your project's theme folder:

```
cd PATH_TO_THE_PROJECT/docroot
cp -r modules/contrib/varbase_components/components/molecules/alert themes/custom/PROJECT_THEME/components/molecules/alert
```

## Add replaces to the Copied Component

Edit the `alert.component.yml` file in your `PROJECT_THEME` folder.&#x20;

Add the following line after `name: Alert` in the YAML file:

```
replaces: 'varbase_components:alert'
```

The updated `alert.component.yml` should look like this:

```
name: Alert
replaces: 'varbase_components:alert'
```

## Add the Custom SCSS files to the Webpack Config for Components

Uncomment the following line in the `PROJECT_THEME/webpack.config.components.js` file:

```
    './components/molecules/alert/alert': ['./components/molecules/alert/alert.scss'],
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** As a custom theme, Developers and themers have the authority to modify any part of the <mark style="color:green;">"</mark><mark style="color:green;">`status-messages.html.twig"`</mark> template file, which is the default system template in Drupal.&#x20;

You can also make changes to the **SASS**, **TWIG**, and **JavaScript** files in the <mark style="color:green;">`components/molecules/alert`</mark> folder.
{% endhint %}

## Compile `SASS` to `CSS` files for components

```
yarn components:build
```

These steps will allow you to incorporate your custom style for the **Alert component**, using the **Varbase Components** module as a base.

## Change the SDC Component to Customize

* Add JS file, or more JS files to dependencies
* Add more SCSS/CSS files
* Change the custom component twig template



## Defining Schemas for SDC Component Metadata

Following with [**Draft 4**](http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema) of **JSON Schema,** which is a declarative language that allows you to **annotate** and **validate** JSON documents.

The draft has been seamlessly integrated with YAML in SDC Components within the Drupal core. This integration now serves as the backbone for all front-end and web components, providing a unified and efficient system.

{% hint style="success" %}
* **Required in modules**
* **Optional in themes** (file presence needed)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Add the Schema Metadata

```php
$schema: https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/raw/10.1.x/core/modules/sdc/src/metadata.schema.json
```

In all SDC components in **Varbase Components** or custom **`myproject_components`** module.

To follow with **metadata.schema.json** selected by Drupal Core team [https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/raw/10.1.x/core/modules/sdc/src/metadata.schema.json](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/raw/10.1.x/core/modules/sdc/src/metadata.schema.json)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The [**IDE**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] will read the schema file to understand the syntax for fixes and enable autocomplete.
{% endhint %}

### Drafts of JSON Schema

JSON Schema Enables the Confident and Reliable use of the JSON Data Format
{% endembed %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Front End frameworks are using a selected draft to create their custom schema metadata for components.

`http://json-schema.org/draft-01/schema#`\
`http://json-schema.org/draft-02/schema#`\
`http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema#`\
`http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#` **( Used by Drupal  core SDC module)**\
`http://json-schema.org/draft-05/schema#`\
`http://json-schema.org/draft-06/schema#`\
`http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#`
{% endhint %}

[Storybook JSON Schema Addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema/) to integrate with that

{% endcontent-ref %}



## Options to custom

* Clone the custom card component, which is targeted for a selected content type, and have the custom changes for with styles(`css`) and scripts(`js`), or even with custom props and slots.
* Switch to use the `starterkit/recipes` for the provided **Varbase Cards** from **Varbase Components** directly from the display mode for an entity.
* Clone the **Varbase Card** component and customize it in a custom theme

## **Proof of Concept: Custom Varbase Blog Card Components**

{% hint style="info" %}
While **Varbase Blog** will retain the use of the standard **Varbase Card Components**, This is an proof of concept example with a selection of custom components.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
[**Varbase Blog**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase\_blog) serves as an exemplary model for understanding how to effectively manage various elements such as **Content types**, **View modes**, **Layout Libraries**, **Views**, **site section pages**, **categories**, and **tags** using the comprehensive range of _**`"assembled"`**_ [**Varbase Components**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase\_components), **modules**, and _**`"Starterkit/Recipes"`**_ configs.
{% endhint %}

### Offering an Example Avenue

Explore customizing card components for specific content types. Our present example revolves around the **Varbase Blog** content type.

{% hint style="success" %}
You're welcome to download the components and tailor them according to your chosen view mode and content type's requirements.
{% endhint %}

Make the transition from the `inline CSS class placement` method for **UI patterns** to using custom **Card components**. Additionally, enhance organization and readability by integrating **Custom Cards** as stories within **Varbase Storybook**.

### **Example:** Use the **General Cards/Teasers**

&#x20;view modes for your site, and if necessary, you can utilize or clone the **Varbase Cards** `Starterkit/Recipe`.

* Incorporate custom Card components when working with specific Content types like the Varbase Blog
* This approach streamlines the development workflow, enabling smooth collaboration between Design, Storybook, Front-End development with SDC components and stories, and the mapping process in the theme. The Back-end team can also effortlessly integrate components into the site structure.
* The **Site builder** gains the flexibility to associate **SDC** components with both **UI Pattern** and **SDC Display**, ensuring a cohesive and efficient implementation.

### Field mapping with Components

Can be managed in number of approaches

**Example first approach:** Use the [**SDC Display**](https://www.drupal.org/project/sdc\_display) module. Select a component for a field display from the UI, and map values to props and slots.\
**Example second approach:** Create a `card-text-body-field` component and use the component with the twig template in **Vartheme BS5** suggestion for the field body.

> ( Building the list of components for fields can be now in projects or products ) Then later SDC Display can map them from the UI.

## **Example:** Impressed Card as a View Mode for a Content Type

> **Example:** Impressed Card with **`style size`** of `medium`, **`card border`**, **`Equal height`**, **`Anchoring all`** the card, **`media position`** to the `top`, and passing an extra **Bootstrap \~5.3.0** **`utility classes`** for `light background` and `large shadow` over the used card
>
> The component files are in ( [varbase-blog-card-impressed-medium.zip](https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2023-08-02/varbase-blog-card-impressed-medium.zip) )
>
> Which only has the following in  `varbase-blog-card-impressed-medium.twig` file:
>
> ```php
> {% include 'varbase_components:card-impressed' with {
>   style_size: 'medium',
>   card_border: true,
>   equal_height: true,
>   anchor_all: true,
>   media_position: 'top',
>   utility_classes: ['bg-light', 'shadow-lg'],
>   media_utility_classes: [],
>   content_utility_classes: [],
>   media: media,
>   content: content,
> } only %}
> ```

The equivalent in Storybook using the custom Varbase Impressed Card -medium

Which is the equivalent of using the default **`Impressed Card - medium - with Read more`** story with the default standard Impressed Card in the storybook - but without the light background and no shadows.
