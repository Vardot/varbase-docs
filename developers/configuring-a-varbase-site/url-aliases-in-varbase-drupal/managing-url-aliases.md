# Managing URL Aliases

### **Viewing and Editing Specific Aliases**

The **List** tab shows a list of all existing URLs on the site with their alias, with a search field to filter for aliases.

Editing an existing alias is possible by clicking on the **Edit** button next to the alias wanted to be edited. The edit alias page will contain two fields:

* **System path** which should point to an existing path on the site.
* **URL alias** which will contain the alias for the system path specified, both of these fields should start with a forward slash (/).

**Hint**: If the site is enabled to be multilingual, a language dropdown will show up to pick the language of which language the alias will be applied to.

The **Add alias** button will allow the user to add a new alias to the site, the add alias page contains two fields which are:

* **URL alias** which will contain the alias for the system path specified, both of these fields should start with a forward slash (/).

### **Bulk Generate Aliases Based on Predefined Patterns**

Pattern type aliases can be deleted individually or you can delete all aliases of the site by navigating to the **Delete** tab.

Another option available is to only delete automatically generated aliases, this can be helpful in case the URL aliases patterns were changed and there is a need to regenerate them.

Bulk generation can be done in the **Bulk generate** to apply the following:

* Generate URL aliases for items that currently have no aliases
* Re-generate URL aliases for items that have an old alias and for which the Pathauto pattern has been changed.

**Warning**: This will only affect items that are configured to have their URL alias automatically set. Items whose URL alias is manually set are not affected.
