# Installing Varbase

If you already have a local or hosted environment available for your use that meets [Drupal system requirements](https://www.drupal.org/requirements) and/or [Varbase's system requirements](requirements.md) including working versions of Apache, MySQL, and PHP, youâ€™re ready to install Varbase.

## Installing Varbase locally with Composer

    ```
    composer create-project Vardot/varbase-project:^10.0@alpha YOUR_PROJECT --no-dev --no-interaction

## Installing Varbase with Lando

We recommend you install Varbase with Lando to start a new project.

[Lando](https://lando.dev/) is a great local development environment for Drupal and other applications that vastly simplifies local development and DevOps so you can focus on the application, rather than the environment.
