You'll also notice that there are 2 more roles when managing roles and permissions. The **Anonymous user** role and the **Authenticated user** role. These roles are provided by default from Drupal and cannot be edited/deleted. These roles help identify the users such as:

**Anonymous user**: Any visitor/user who can access the website without providing a username or password.

**Authenticated user**: Any user who can access the website by providing a username or password.
