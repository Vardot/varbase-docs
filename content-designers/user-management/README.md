# User Management

All users that can access the site have a defined role. Within each role, there are a set of permissions provided to each role.

The default roles that come preinstalled with Varbase are:

1. **Editor**
2. **Content admin**
3. **SEO admin**
4. **Site admin**

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll also notice that there are 2 more roles when managing roles and permissions. The **Anonymous user** role and the **Authenticated user** role. These roles are provided by default from Drupal and cannot be edited/deleted.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
