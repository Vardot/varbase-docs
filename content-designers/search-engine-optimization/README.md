# Search Engine Optimization

## **SEO Tips**

Search engine optimization is often about making small modifications to parts of your website. When viewed individually, these changes might seem like incremental improvements, but when combined with other optimizations, they could have a noticeable impact on your site’s user experience and performance in organic search results.

The following is a list of tips for Editors to follow as a guideline when adding content to the site:
