# Content Structure

When a content designer goes to add new content to the site, they are presented with a list of content types to choose from to get the appropriate form to fill out. Each content type defines the fields it contains, along with default content settings like submission form and publishing options. They each serve a particular content purpose on the site. For example, a site might have a different content type for blog posts, news, and articles, each with their own set of fields that pertain to that kind of content.
