### Previewing View Modes

Another option available when previewing the content is to preview the view modes available for the entity being previewed.

A view mode list will show up below the administrator bar to the right, changing view modes will show the content in the selected view mode.

Selecting a view mode will result in changing the view mode to the one selected.

The view mode list will show the view modes available for the entity, in case the entity has no view modes or one view mode then it will only appear in its original view mode.
