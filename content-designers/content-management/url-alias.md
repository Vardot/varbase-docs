# URL Alias

Once any node is created, an automatic URL is generated. To keep the website user-friendly, a URL alias is generated to mask the technical/numbered URL. This is referred to as the URL alias. In all content types on the site, a specific URL alias pattern has been determined and used. Site Admins have permission to edit the URL Alias to customize it further.&#x20;

The following are steps on how to override the URL alias:

1- Go to the **Content** you would like to edit and click on **Edit.**
